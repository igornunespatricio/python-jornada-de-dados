# OOP

Encapsulation

Classes bundle data and methods together, hiding internal implementation details.

Inheritance and Polymorphism

Classes enable code reuse through inheritance and flexible behavior through polymorphism.

Inheritance is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties, behaviors and methods. The new class can then add or modify functionality without rewriting everything from scratch.

Polymorphism

What it is: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.

Focus: Behavior variation and interface consistency

Analogy: "Different animals make different sounds"

super() enables use of methods from parent/superior class

Organization and Maintainability

Classes provide a natural way to organize related functionality.

Multiple Instances

Classes make it easy to create multiple independent instances.

Abstract method decorator from ABC module is used to enforce methods are implemented in child classes. If methods are not implemented, an error is thrown.
